            <p class="text-center biggerP "><big>In everyday life, there is the tendency to concentrate on the advantage of the action that we take, and not
                the disadvantage. We buy a smart-phone to be able to communicate and/or work, take the plane to travel
                to discover new places and learn from other cultures. We are almost never thinking about the negatives
                consequences of our consumer behaviours.</big></p>
        <p class="text-center biggerP"><big>With this project, we argue that for every action there are choices made (conscious or unconscious): we choose
            personal goods and sacrifice something on the way, or renounce to a certain comfort in order to feel good with
            our conscience. Most of the time it is not easy and it is possible to feel stuck on the edge, on the border, between
            ethics and necessity or desire. It is this human condition of living in a state of denial or helplessness we wanted
            to explore: the complex relation between life/goods and death/destruction</big></p>

        <p class="text-center biggerP "><big>SAAD is composed of two complementary installations: a seed dispenser and a plant, visualising deaths due to
            the mining industry in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). It aims to push the reflexion of the responsibility
            Western consumer users of smartphones and computers have towards these workers.
            It plays on the feeling of being helpless towards the different issues our societies are facing. The project is
            constructed on different layers which all recall the idea of being on the edge, the border between life and death,
            and emphasise the complexity of nothing being either totally positive or negative. It aims to symbolise the
            complexity of today’s world and the difficulty to position the self and the ethic in it.
            We choose to focus on the partial perspective we have of our electronic devices nowadays, as it is something
            most Europeans possessed and use everyday without questioning the impact it can have on other human
            beings and the natural environment.</big></p>

    <div class="row padded">
        <div class="col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12"><img src="res/plant.png" class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"> </div>
        <div class="col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"><p class="large">The installation is made of a plant enclosed in a plexiglass box, preventing
                anyone to be able to water it. A watering system is releasing a drop of water
                when statistically a miner dies either from an accident in a mine, a disease in
                consequence of the working condition, or civil war financed by conflict minerals.</p>
            <p class="large">The viewer is placed in a helpless position: watching the plant perish because no
                one is dying, or being in good shape because people are suffering on the other side
                of the planet. It allows them to recall the feeling we encounter when realising that
                our consumerism habits can have harmful consequences for either the environment
                or other human being, but we do not have other alternatives (apart from dropping
                out of the society). The plant has been carefully chosen. Its name is Euphorbia
                Abyssinica, originating from Africa, from the Uphorbiaceae Family. It is used both to
                create medicine (the latex is used as a purgative and as a caustic on skin lesions)
                or as a poison to kill or commit suicide (Welham, n.d.). It conveys the complexity of
                being good and bad at the same time: health and death. The water holds the same
                conflict: lifeblood of the planet, indispensable for all forms of life, symbolising here
                the death of human being.</p>

        <h2>THE SEED DISPENSER</h2>
        <p class="text-left large"> On the same system and data as the PLANT, this installation is releasing a seeds. Visitors can take one (if there is any), put it in an envelope to
            bring it home. The envelope is stamped with brief explanations of the project, the link to access the website and informations on how to take care
            of the plant.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left large"> 
            Even if it is the same set of data used, this other ‘visualisation’ is complementary to the first one. When the plant suggests the state of being
            helpless as Western consumers in front of the condition of the miners in DRC, this one aims to encourage long-term thinking on the situation. By
            having to plant the seed and then take care of it, the owner will have a constant reminder of the situation in his environment. It is meant to act as
            opposition to the short term thinking caused by the continuous information flow experienced by Western consumers.
            Another layer of symbolism is in the act of planting the seed, embodying the data, that is to say, it is the symbol of the death of a human being.
            It recalls the act of burying the miner, aiming to materialise the link between the new owner of the seed, a western consumers and the mining
            industry in DRC.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">
            <p class="large">We made the choice of using baobab seeds because it is an African
                Landmark. It recalls the partial perspective we have of the continent, as in
                reality it is not present on all the African territory, and to be more precise, it
                is not a tree present in DRC, but everywhere around. It is playing with our
                assumptions and beliefs, and at the same time because it is a symbol, it
                helps to create the connection with an issue in an African country.
                Another layer of the decision to choose baobab seeds recalls the choice of
                the Euphorbia Abyssinica. It also has a dimension of being good and bad at
                the same time. It is considered by many Africans (the sources doesn’t give
                me the possibilities to be more precise) to be ‘The Tree of Life”. In the other
                hand, the baobab tree in Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s The Little Prince is the
                symbol of danger, having the tendency to invaded the asteroid, threatening
                the roses, the little prince adores. Literature annalists suggest that the trees
                are the author’s visual metaphor for Nazism. The duality of this symbol
                recalls the subject of this project; wealth and health one one side, invasion
                and destruction on the other.</p>
