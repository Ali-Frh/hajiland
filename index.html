      Playing on these feelings, SAAD, from Afrikaans meaning Seed, is visualising human deaths as a direct and indirect result of the mining industry and conflict minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), used to build smart-phones and computers.
      The project is constructed on different layers which all recall the idea of being on the edge, the border between life and death, and emphasise the complexity of nothing being either totally positive or negative.

        SAAD is composed of two complementary installations: a seed dispenser and a plant, visualising deaths due to the mining industry in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). It aims to push the reflexion of the responsibility Western consumer users of smartphones
        and computers have towards these workers. It plays on the feeling of being helpless towards the different issues our societies are facing. The project is constructed on different layers which all recall the idea of being on the edge, the border
        between life and death, and emphasise the complexity of nothing being either totally positive or negative. It aims to symbolise the complexity of today’s world and the difficulty to position the self and the ethic in it. We choose to focus on
        the partial perspective we have of our electronic devices nowadays, as it is something most Europeans possessed and use everyday without questioning the impact it can have on other human beings and the natural environment.

        <section class="lead text-justify paddingLeft20">The installation is made of a plant enclosed in a plexiglass box, preventing anyone to be able to water it. A watering system is releasing a drop of water when statistically a miner dies either from an accident in a mine, a disease in consequence
          of the working condition, or civil war financed by conflict minerals.
        </section>
        <section class="lead text-justify paddingLeft20 marginTop30">The viewer is placed in a helpless position: watching the plant perish because no one is dying, or being in good shape because people are suffering on the other side of the planet. It allows them to recall the feeling we encounter when realising
          that our consumerism habits can have harmful consequences for either the environment or other human being, but we do not have other alternatives (apart from dropping out of the society). The plant has been carefully chosen. Its name is Euphorbia
          Abyssinica, originating from Africa, from the Uphorbiaceae Family. It is used both to create medicine (the latex is used as a purgative and as a caustic on skin lesions) or as a poison to kill or commit suicide (Welham, n.d.). It conveys the
          complexity of being good and bad at the same time: health and death. The water holds the same conflict: lifeblood of the planet, indispensable for all forms of life, symbolising here the death of human being.

        Even if it is the same set of data used, this other ‘visualisation’ is complementary to the first one. When the plant suggests the state of being helpless as Western consumers in front of the condition of the miners in DRC, this one aims to encourage
        long-term thinking on the situation. By having to plant the seed and then take care of it, the owner will have a constant reminder of the situation in his environment. It is meant to act as opposition to the short term thinking caused by the continuous
        information flow experienced by Western consumers. Another layer of symbolism is in the act of planting the seed, embodying the data, that is to say, it is the symbol of the death of a human being. It recalls the act of burying the miner, aiming
        to materialise the link between the new owner of the seed, a western consumers and the mining industry in DRC.

        <section class="lead">We made the choice of using baobab seeds because it is an African Landmark. It recalls the partial perspective we have of the continent, as in reality it is not present on all the African territory, and to be more precise, it is not a tree present
          in DRC, but everywhere around. It is playing with our assumptions and beliefs, and at the same time because it is a symbol, it helps to create the connection with an issue in an African country. Another layer of the decision to choose baobab
          seeds recalls the choice of the Euphorbia Abyssinica. It also has a dimension of being good and bad at the same time. It is considered by many Africans (the sources doesn’t give me the possibilities to be more precise) to be ‘The Tree of Life”.
          In the other hand, the baobab tree in Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s The Little Prince is the symbol of danger, having the tendency to invaded the asteroid, threatening the roses, the little prince adores. Literature annalists suggest that the trees
          are the author’s visual metaphor for Nazism. The duality of this symbol recalls the subject of this project; wealth and health one one side, invasion and destruction on the other.

        The germination rate for baobab seeds can be low, slow and sporadic so sow two to three times the amount of seed required to ensure you get enough stock. Be aware that it can take 3-4 months from your first Baobab seedling to germinate until your last
        one pokes its head above the compost.
      </section>
      <section class="text-justify lead">
        Planting seed approximately 1/2 in. deep in the compost and water well using warm water. The seeds can now be moved to a sunny position. Considering the baobabs natural environment, they will need as much light as possible, and may even benefit from supplemental
        lighting. It is imperative that you use a very well-drained growing medium. In order to germinate the baobab seeds the soil temperature will need to be kept at between 15 and 19 degrees Celsius.

        Only water again when the growing medium is barely moist to the touch. Even then, do not soak them. Half water them, keeping the seeds barely moist as baobab seedlings are very prone to root rot. Please note that once the seedlings show through the compost,
        do not attempt to remove the shell covering.
      </section>
      <section class="text-justify lead">
        Transplant the seedlings when they are large enough to handle into 3 inch pots, again using a very free draining compost. You can pot on as required into 5 inch and finally 8 inch pots.

        If it is warm enough for you to overwintering your Baobab outside then it will need to be under protection from the rain - just make sure that it is fully ventilated to prevent fungal rots. Make sure that winter temperatures do not drop below 10 degrees
        Celsius. If this is likely then the Baobab will need to be brought in under temperature controlled protection such as the sunniest room in the house or a heated greenhouse.

        Although the condition of mine workers have improved in the past few years, and in particularly in South Africa where The South African mining industry has reported a significant drop in the number of fatalities and injuries, thanks to better-working
        conditions (Brand SA, 2015). However, there is still major social problems associated with the activity, including high accident rates in the mines due to low safety, high rates of HIV infection, land conflicts caused by the presence of large
        transient populations, crime, poor sanitation, and child labour, in order to extract minerals essential for the electronics industry (Boocock, 2002; Nutt, 2012; Poulsen, 2012; Smith & Carrington, 2015). Miners have also more health problems, which
        decreased their life expectancy (increased frequency of cancer of the trachea, bronchus, lung, stomach, and liver, pulmonary tuberculosis, silicosis, pleural diseases, malaria, dengue fever; noise-induced, hearing loss; bacterial and viral diseases;
        blood, skin, and musculoskeletal system diseases (Eisler, 2003)). The situation is particularly unacceptable in the DRC, where the extracted metals, called conflict minerals, are financing the armed conflicts in the area. The fourth main conflict
        minerals are gold, cassiterite, coltan, and wolframite. The last three are sometimes referred to under the acronym 3T, a reference to the tin, tantalum, and tungsten metals derived from them (Heath, 2014). The working conditions are described
        as slavery (Heath, 2014; Nutt, 2012; Poulsen, 2010). This testimony described the part of the life of the workers: “Sometimes people worked 24 hours out of 24, night and day, using head-mounted lamps — one team working days and one doing nights.
        At the time there were no rules, and sometimes miners died of fatigue. There were also deaths because the pits were deep and there was flooding” (Heath, 2014). It is difficult to trace if electronic devices are conflict mineral-free or coming
        from a mine where the working condition is acceptable, as the supply chain is opaque, travelling to Asia and elsewhere to be smelted into metals (Heath, 2014). Reporter Heath explains that “by shining a spotlight on electronics manufacturers’
        supply chains, legislators are hoping to pressure companies to invest in removing conflict minerals from their products” (2014). It is moving in the right direction. Nevertheless, the problem is that there simply aren’t enough of these conflict-free
        smelters to meet the needs of the world’s biggest computer makers, and there are still companies that currently have no idea whether their products are ‘conflict-free’ (Heath, 2014; Schiller, 2012; Schwartz, 2012). The report Taking Conflict Out
        of Consumer Gadgets claims that “consumer activism will continue to serve as a motivator for corporate action that demonstrates the market potential for ethical products as well as an effective entry point for a national and international movement
        dedicated to peace in Congo” (Lezhnev & Hellmuth, 2012). However, Heath argues that stopping sourcing minerals from the DRC and its neighbouring countries, expose another issue, as it would kill what could be a valuable part of these fragile countries’
        economies (2014). What can be seen at first appearance as a solution, can bring to light other issues.

        In order to calculate at which rate the water will be released, we had to define and select which data to use. There are not any statistics reflecting the average number of deaths due to mining industry. The issue in DRC is too complex and factor in many
        variables. The death can be the result of the armed conflict, infectious diseases or for example, as mentioned above HIV. At first appearance, there is no link between HIV and mines. However, this industry in DRC (and other countries in Africa
        such as South Africa) is often connected to commercial sex, resulting in many infections for the workers, such as HIV, spreading the infection even outside the working site (Bollinger & Stover). To start, we set against the death rate of UK with
        the one in DRC, allowing us to have a point of comparison. Surprisingly, according to United Nations Population Division, World Population Prospects, United Nations Statistical Division, and Population and Vital Statistics Report, they have a
        very similar death rates (Central Intelligence Agency, 2014; Index Mundi, 2014a, 2014b; M. J. Morgan, 2009). However, this similarity coincides with the UK having an ageing population with 17.5% over 65 years old while in DRC only 2.6% of the
        population is over the age of 65. The ratio of children under 14 years old in the UK is 17.3% while in DRC 43.1% are under 14 years old (Central Intelligence Agency, 2014; Index Mundi, 2014a, 2014b). The above comparison between UK and DRC suggests
        the relationship of the existing conflicts, infectious diseases and mining industries that are all feeding to one another as the cause of young population and low life expectancy inside DRC. According to Poulsen, director of “Blood in the mobile”
        “these resources have ended up fuelling the bloodiest war since WWII” (Poulsen, 2010). It is estimated that 5 million people have died since 1998 and 300.000 women have been raped (Heath, 2014; Poulsen, 2010; enough, n.d.). It is in average 870
        persons per day who died in the past 17 years: 36 per hour, in connection to the mining industry in the country. Our installation aims to show the continuity of this issue over the 10 days of the ECA Master degree show 2015. The exhibition is
        open from 11am to 5pm, that is to say 6h per day equivalent to the death of 216 persons. The watering system will release 11 drops of water during a day at randomly generated intervals. Each drop will represent 20 individuals dying in the Democratic
        Republic of Congo.
